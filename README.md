# ✈️ Airline Data Management and Analysis Using Power BI

This Power BI project analyzes airline operations using flight schedules, passenger details, and ticketing systems. It was completed as part of the **Data Science Placement Guarantee Program** by Internshala Trainings.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The airline industry operates with numerous complexities, requiring effective data management and insights into flight schedules, passenger details, and ticketing systems. This project aims to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through data-driven dashboards.

## 📂 Datasets Used

- **Flight_Information**: FlightID, FlightNumber, Airline, Destination, Status  
- **Passenger_Information**: PassengerID, FlightID, SeatNumber  
- **Ticket_Information**: TicketID, FlightID, BookingStatus  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and model airline data using Power BI  
- Generate insights into flight performance, passenger management, and ticket booking trends  
- Build interactive dashboards with filters and row-level security  

## 🛠️ Project Tasks

### 1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, formatted columns  
- Performed transformations in Power Query  

### 2. Data Modeling
- Created relationships using FlightID  
- Configured cardinality and cross-filtering  

### 3. Enhanced Data Insights
- Classified flights as "Best" or "To Be Improved" based on status  
- Extracted flight numbers using "Column from Examples"  

### 4. DAX Calculations
- Total passengers per flight  
- Total tickets booked  
- Filtered table for "Best" flights  

### 5. Visualizations and Interactivity
- Passenger count by airline  
- Ticket booking statuses  
- Flights by airline and destination  
- Interactive filters for airline and destination  
- Quick views and airline-specific pages  

### 6. Final Dashboard and Power BI Service
- Published dashboard with key visuals  
- Configured Row-Level Security (RLS) for Airline A  
- Scheduled daily refresh at 5 PM  

## 📊 Final Deliverables

- 📄 PDF report with screenshots and documentation  
- 🎥 3–5 minute video walkthrough explaining the project
